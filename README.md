# Architecting-For-The-Cloud


## The (AWS) Well Architected Framework

_The Well-Architected Framework has been developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications. Based on five pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization — the Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that will scale over time._

###1) Operational Excellence

   Download the Operational Excellence [whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Operational-Excellence-Pillar.pdf)

   **Design Principles**

   There are six design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:

    * Perform operations as code
    * Annotate documentation
    * Make frequent, small, reversible changes
    * Refine operations procedures frequently
    * Anticipate failure
    * Learn from all operational failures


###2) Security

   Download the Security Pillar [whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Security-Pillar.pdf)

   **Design Principles**

    * Implement a strong identity foundation
    * Enable traceability
    * Apply security at all layers
    * Automate security best practices
    * Protect data in transit and at rest
    * Prepare for security events


###3) Reliability

   Download the Reliability Pillar [whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Reliability-Pillar.pdf)

   **Design Principles**

    * Test recovery procedures
    * Automatically recover from failure
    * Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
    * Stop guessing capacity
    * Manage change in automation




###4) Performance Efficiency

   Download the Performance Efficiency [whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Performance-Efficiency-Pillar.pdf)

    **Design Principles**

    * Democratize advanced technologies
    * Go global in minutes
    * Use serverless architectures
    * Experiment more often
    * Mechanical sympathy


###5) Cost Optimization

   Download the Cost Optimization [whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Cost-Optimization-Pillar.pdf)

   **Design Principles**

    *Adopt a consumption model
    *Measure overall efficiency
    *Stop spending money on data center operations
    *Analyze and attribute expenditure
    *Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership
